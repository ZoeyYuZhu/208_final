Linear SVM with different embeddings

Linear SVM's (SVM with linear kernels) have this advantages that there are many O(n) training algorithms. They are really fast in comparison with other nonlinear SVM (where most of them are O(n^2)). This technique is really useful if you want to train on big data.
